# Process Notes — Swiss Example

This file documents the steps taken to create the Swiss example page.

- Scaffolded `docs/swiss/index.html` from `docs/style-template.html` and adapted content to Swiss design principles.
- Added `research/swiss/references.md` with primary sources and external links.
- Demo uses existing SVGs from `docs/assets/` to illustrate typographic and grid-driven examples.

Recommendations for students:
- Replace placeholder copy with your researched paragraphs and citations.
- Add screenshots during building and include them here (5–10 images recommended).
- Run `python3 -m http.server 8000` from `docs/` to preview locally.
