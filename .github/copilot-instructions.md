# Design-Style — Copilot Instructions

Purpose: Give an AI coding agent the essential, discoverable knowledge to work productively on this static design showcase.

- **Big picture:** This is a small static site (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS) that demonstrates a Material/Pixel visual language. Content lives under `docs/` (pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, `examples.html`) and visual assets live in `docs/assets/`. Styling is in `docs/style.css` and there is a combined/minified style blob in `docs/assests` (note: spelled `assests` in repo).

- **Major patterns/components:**
  - Central layout classes: `container`, `row-between`, `grid-3`, `grid-4` — use these for spacing and responsive grid behavior (see `docs/style.css`).
  - Elevation system: `elevation-1`, `elevation-2`, `elevation-4`, `elevation-6` (and corresponding shadows in the combined CSS). Keep these class names when adding new surfaces.
  - Interaction utilities: `ripple` (adds a JS ripple effect and `.ripple-effect` CSS), `animate` with `.delay-1/.delay-2/.delay-3` and an IntersectionObserver in the page scripts to toggle `.visible`.
  - Reusable UI pieces: `.card`, `.about-card`, `.mini-card`, `.phone-mockup`, `.fab`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-outline`.

- **Where behavior lives:** Minimal vanilla JS is embedded in the HTML pages (e.g., `docs/index.html`) — it handles IntersectionObserver animations, ripple generation, and `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback. If you move behavior, preserve accessibility checks (reduced-motion) and the exact ripple sizing logic.

- **Files to inspect/edit for changes:**
  - `docs/index.html` — landing page and the single-page JS examples (good source of interactive patterns).
  - `docs/style.css` — canonical human-authored stylesheet.
  - `docs/assests` — autogenerated/combined CSS + helper HTML scaffold used in the project (contains additional utility classes like `.row-between`, `.delay-*`, `.site-title`, and `--shadow` tokens).
  - `docs/assets/` — SVG placeholders used across pages (`md-color.svg`, `md-components.svg`, etc.).

- **Serving / local preview:** There is no build step. Use a static server to preview:
  - Quick: `python3 -m http.server 8000` (run from `docs/`) or
  - Node: `npx serve docs` or VS Code Live Server on the `docs/` folder.

- **Editing conventions / constraints:**
  - Keep all internal links relative (e.g., `about.html`, `index.html#components`). Moving files may require updating links.
  - Reuse existing utility classes rather than inventing new spacing/elevation classes. Add small helper classes only when necessary and document them in `docs/style.css`.
  - Prefer SVG assets in `docs/assets/` for illustrations — existing pages reference those by filename.
  - Accessibility: maintain `aria-label`/`role` where present (header nav, back-to-top FAB). Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` handling found in the inline scripts.

- **Examples (explicit):**
  - Animation: `docs/index.html` uses an IntersectionObserver that adds `.visible` to elements with `.animate`. When adding a new animated component, add `.animate` and optionally `.delay-1` / `.delay-2` for stagger.
  - Ripple: elements with class `ripple` rely on inline JS that creates a `span.ripple-effect`, sizes it to the element, and removes it after ~700ms. Keep this pattern when adding clickable controls.
  - Elevation: apply `elevation-2` / `elevation-6` to approximate card/app-bar depth (see `docs/style.css` and the combined CSS in `docs/assests`).

- **Dependencies & external links:**
  - Google Fonts: pages include Roboto via Google Fonts; do not remove unless replacing with a bundled font.
  - External design references are intentionally linked in `docs/index.html` resources — these are documentation links, not runtime deps.

- **Tests / CI / builds:**
  - None present. No package.json or build tooling detected. Keep changes minimal and test by serving `docs/` locally.

- **Commit/messages guidance for AI agents:**
  - Small, focused commits. Title should summarize intent (e.g., "Add new card variant using existing elevation classes"). Mention files changed in the body and any visual impact.

- **When to ask owner:**
  - If a proposed change introduces a new global design token (color, radius, shadow) or a new build step, confirm before applying.

If any section above is unclear or you want more examples (component-level HTML/CSS snippets or a short preview script), tell me which area to expand.
